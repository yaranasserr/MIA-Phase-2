**PLAN**
1. Start 
2. Move(forward) downward to the green label at the lower right -> 0.1+0.6 distance
3. Use ultrasonic sensor to prevent hitting the fence (margin 10 cm)
4. Move (backward) upward to reach at the upper right using the ultrasensor to detect 1.4m
5. IR sensor at the back to detect the green label , Once it is detected  decrease the velocity 
6. Move downward 0.3 ,and rotate left 
7. Case 1:
   - Move forward distance of 0.5 to pass on the two green labels 
   - BINGO
8. Case 2:
   - Move from third green label with an angle to reach the bingos and push them to the trash
   - Rotate and Move forward to the forth green label 
   - To reach MIA zone 
   - With IR sensors , count the green labels , when count 4 is reached , slow down to rotate
